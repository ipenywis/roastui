# Design Roasting Guidelines

This guide will help you get the most accurate and valuable feedback for your designs using our AI-powered roasting system.

## How Our Roasting System Works

Our AI models are optimized to analyze specific design elements and components rather than entire pages. By focusing on individual elements, you'll receive more detailed and actionable feedback.

## Core Principles

1. **Be Specific**: Submit focused screenshots of individual design elements
2. **Stay Focused**: One component or section at a time yields better results
3. **Maintain Context**: Ensure the screenshot includes enough surrounding context
4. **Keep it Clear**: High-quality less pixelated images lead to more accurate analysis and better feedback results

## Best Practices for Image Submission

### Do's ✅
- Submit individual components (e.g., navigation bar, hero section, pricing cards)
- Capture clear, high-resolution screenshots
- Include just enough context around the element
- Focus on one design pattern at a time
- Ensure text in the image is readable

### Don'ts ❌
- Avoid full-page screenshots (break them into sections)
- Don't submit blurry or low-quality images
- Skip overlapping or mixed components
- Avoid screenshots with personal/sensitive information
- Don't crop too tightly (some context is needed, e.g. a form with a border)

## Examples of Good Submissions

### Component-Level Screenshots:
- Navigation bar only
- Individual card component
- Form element with its immediate context
- Call-to-action section
- Footer section
- Individual modal or popup
- Specific interaction state (e.g., hover state, active state)

### Example Scenarios:

#### ✅ Good Example:
```
Submitting a screenshot of just the navigation bar to get feedback on:
- Menu item spacing
- Button placement
- Brand logo positioning
- Color scheme
- Contrast
- Accessibility
- Labels and helper text
```

#### ❌ Poor Example:
```
Submitting a full landing page screenshot asking for general feedback
(Too broad, won't get detailed component-specific insights and the AI will not be able to generate a good improved version)
```

## Understanding AI Analysis

- Our AI focuses on design principles for specific components
- Feedback is more precise when analyzing individual elements
- Each component is evaluated against established design patterns
- Analysis includes accessibility and usability considerations

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Break Down Designs**: Split full pages into individual components
2. **Focus Areas**: Submit separate images for different aspects of the same component
3. **Multiple Angles**: Consider submitting different states of the same component
4. **Clean Captures**: Use proper screenshot tools for crisp images
5. **Context Matters**: Include just enough surrounding elements for context


## Future Improvements

- We are working on improving the AI model to handle more complex designs and components.
- We are also working on improving the feedback to be more actionable and helpful.
- We will allow passing custom prompts to the AI to handle more specific feedback requests & get tailored results.
